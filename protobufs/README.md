## Protocol Buffers
Protocol Buffers (protobufs) are a language- and platform-neutral data serialization format developed by Google. They are designed to be simple, efficient, and extensible, and are used for a wide variety of applications, including network communication, data storage, and data processing.

## Benefits of Using Protocol Buffers
`Efficiency:` Protocol Buffers are optimized for size and speed, making them an efficient choice for serializing data.

`Language-neutral:` Protocol Buffers can be used with any programming language, allowing for easy communication between systems written in different languages.

`Extensibility:` Protocol Buffers allow for the addition of new fields to existing message types without breaking backwards compatibility.

`Strongly-typed:` Protocol Buffers enforce strict type checking, ensuring that data is consistently serialized and deserialized.

`Type safety:` Protobufs provide a way to define the structure and types of data being exchanged, which can help ensure that the client and server are in agreement about the data being exchanged. This can help prevent issues with contract testing, as it allows you to catch errors early on in the development process.

Overall, Protobufs can be a useful tool for contract testing, particularly when you need to exchange large amounts of data efficiently and maintain backward compatibility over time.




## Using Protocol Buffers

To use Protocol Buffers, you will need to define the structure of your data in a `.proto` file using the Protocol Buffer language. This file will define the `message` `types` and `fields` that you want to `serialize`.

Once you have defined your message types in a `.proto` file, you can use the `protoc` compiler to generate code in your chosen language that can be used to serialize and deserialize the data.

For example, to generate Java code for a `Person` message defined in a `person.proto` file, you can run the following command:

``
protoc --java_out=./gen/proto/java person
``
## Directory Structure for protobuf

`protobufs` folder contains `gen` directory where all the plugins for different languages are generated. The `protos` folder contains the proto files.

Purpose of working on this project is to demonstrate how MicroServices can work together in an ecosystem to build any type of product!

Microservices are a way of designing and building software systems that allow for flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.
In a microservices architecture, a single application is built as a suite of small, independent services that communicate with each other
using well-defined APIs.
